Introduction/Business Problem

People who is looking for a similar city to live in New York, trying to get all amenities they have in Toronto. 
When moving out somewhere else due to work, family or any other, is very important to reduce stress as much as possible, 
one of the most common stressful things is to arrive somewhere that you don’t even know what kind of venues you have 
available to visit and feel that everything is as close as you have them in your own home, with this project we are going 
to make it easy for those who have to be involved in these processes, so they can feel like their home faster that people 
that don’t consider this as an issue. When people moving out somewhere else for different reasons, sometimes it’s difficult 
for them and their families since they feel themselves as strangers where they have to start call home. Leaving all behind 
they lose time when feeling and adapting to new things.

Data Section
The data used for this project is the one used for last labs New York segmentation and Toronto Clustering and segmentation.
Both of them consist of their boroughs, neighborhoods and the locations. Besides, we are going to use Foursquare in order to 
get the information regarding these location’s venues.

Methodology Section
By loading and reading the data, we are going to use Foursquare in order to get the venues nearby these specific locations. 
We are going to select a random point in Toronto and we are going to cluster the cities using most of the venues in a specific 
range that we can identify as a regular range where most of the venues or the most important venues are in this range. At the 
end we are going to compare 5 clusters in every city, considering as many venues of the same category in every one of the five 
clusters, so the cluster in New York with the main venues nearby, is the best place to move in New York. 

Result Section
After the visualization, we can say that there are many neighborhoods in New York that are really similar that any random neighborhood 
in Toronto. Talking about main services, cluster #1 is the best place to live considering that cluster #1 in Toronto has as many venues 
as we desire. Supermarkets, gyms, coffee shops, restaurants, etc. all nearby cluster #1 in New York, as we can find them in cluster #1 
in Toronto as well. 

Discussion Section
I focused this project in similarities between two different cities in two different countries, there are many other things we can 
consider when moving to a different city, we can consider cost of life in that specific city, schools, beaches, malls, etc, it depends 
on every individual, but I took the most common venues we need to survive.

Conclusion Section
After analyze both cities, by applying machine learning algorithm (K-means clustering), I realized that many  venues are in both the 
cities but are distributed differently for both of them and it's the nature and circumstances as well as arrangement which leads to 
these different distribution in both cities.
